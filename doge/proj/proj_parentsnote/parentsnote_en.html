          <h3>Step I</h3>
          <h4>Getting to know the users</h4>
          <p>To gain valuable insights, I used several research methods. First, I did in-depth interviews with pregnant
            couples at different stages. I listened to their needs and challenges. Next, I studied the interface design,
            features, and user experience of similar applications. I also reviewed relevant literature and industry
            reports. Through these methods, I gained comprehensive user insights and market intelligence. This provided
            reliable guidance for the design process.</p>

                <h5>Insight #1: The features that users truly require</h5>
              </div>
              <p>After interviewing some pregnant couples and utilizing similar apps, I discovered that not all of the
                functionalities are actually required by the users. Some of the full-featured pregnancy apps are so
                complicated that users struggle to find the functions they need quickly. But some of them are too
                simplistic to suit their needs.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Users who are men are more interested in learning about what they should be aware of during their
                wives' pregnancies and how they may better assist their spouses. Female users want to be able to
                communicate with other moms in addition to the basic features of recording and querying information.</p>

              </div>
              <p>According to the interviews, several apps have added merchandising features to encourage users to buy
                mom and baby products, which includes advertisements. None of the three couples I interviewed were happy
                about it.</p>

              <h4>It's brainstorming time</h4>
              <p>Using the gathered information, I began constructing the application's sitemap and wireframes. This was
                primarily to define the structure of the app and the flow of user interactions. By creating the sitemap,
                I was able to clearly understand the relationships between the various modules of the app and ensure
                users could smoothly navigate and use the app's features. The wireframes were used to describe the page
                layout and element arrangement, helping me further refine the design and interaction details of the user
                interface. </p>

          <div class="step2-improvement">
            <h5>Wireframe</h5>
            <p>The application is divided into three sections: the homepage, community page, and account management
              page. In this step, I began considering how to design the layout and other functional details to enhance
              the user experience. For instance, on the homepage toolbar, I included the ability for users to customize
              and adjust features based on their preferences.</p>

                This stage focused on building an interactive interface to test and validate the design. I added basic
                features and navigation, keeping the design simple and user-friendly while ensuring consistent branding.
                User feedback will help optimize the design for the final high-fidelity prototype, ensuring a great user

            childbirth experience. The main testing tasks included account registration, testing the mood tracking
            feature, and using all the small tools they would typically need.</p>

            <h5>Improvement #1: Reduce the number of steps in the functionality</h5>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I focused on user experience, continuously collecting feedback and making optimizations. Through user research,
        competitive analysis, and user testing, I integrated these insights into the design. This approach allows users
        to easily find the features they need while offering a personalized experience to meet diverse needs. By
        interacting with users and gathering feedback in the later stages, I consistently refined the design to ensure
        the best possible experience. Throughout the design process, I paid attention to detail and the emotional
        expression of the user, believing that this app will help expectant couples better enjoy their pregnancy journey
        and access the information and support they need.
